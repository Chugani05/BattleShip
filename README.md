## Description

A Python terminal-based game where the player faces a randomly generated 10x10 board filled with ships of various lengths. The objective is to sink all ships by selecting coordinates (e.g., `A5`) to attack. The game ends when all ships are sunk, ensuring strategy and precision in every move. 

## Game Development

- **Only one player** plays with a randomly generated `board`.
- This initial board (`board`) will have a size of 10x10 (as a list of lists) where each cell can be:
  - **Empty**, represented by an empty string.
  - **Ship**, represented by a combination of letter + digit.
- The following ships will be present:
  - 1 ship of length 5 (`5A`)
  - 1 ship of length 4 (`4A`)
  - 2 ships of length 3 (`3A` and `3B`)
  - 1 ship of length 2 (`2A`)
- In each "turn," the player must specify the shooting position: `A4`, `B7`, `C1`, ... where the letters represent rows and the numbers represent columns.
- Shooting at a cell that is already occupied or outside the board is not allowed.
- In each "turn," the board with the attempted shots must be displayed:
  - **Unexplored cell** represented by â¬›
  - **Missed shot (water)** represented by ğŸŸ¦
  - **Hit ship** represented by ğŸŸ§
  - **Sunk ship** represented by ğŸŸ¥
- Each turn must show:
  - Number of turns.
  - Number of ships left to sink.
  - Score so far.
- The game ends when all ships have been sunk.

## Example of Board

The initial board shows the location of each ship and their identifiers. Here's an example:

## Scoring

| Move             | Score                  |
| ---------------- | ---------------------- |
| MISS (WATER)     | -1                     |
| HIT              | 2 \* Ship's Length      |
| HIT AND SUNK     | 4 \* Ship's Length      |

> ğŸ’¡ The "global" score cannot be less than zero.
